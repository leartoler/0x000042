        <h1>Open technology as a way of understanding the image of the world</h1>
        <!-- <h4>The Shape of Design • Chapter Two</h4> -->
        <p>
            There have been several authors who have tried to define the essential
            characteristics of our time, taking elements that are significant to
            them, either the cultural, the political, the social or, as we will see
            below, the technological.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            In this text, I propose an image and understanding of the contemporary
            world through the social and cultural change that comes from science and
            information technologies. To this end, I will take up Heidegger’s
            concept of world image, which in the first instance defines the
            essential characteristics that existed in modernity. Later, to
            understand the impact of technology and science I will consider the
            thought of Ihde, and Yuk Hui for the understanding of technology in the
            image of the contemporary world. Finally, I propose how to define our
            time based on collaborative science and technology, which, as we can
            see, is one of the characteristics that will increase after the COVID-19
            crisis.
        </p>

        <h2>World Picture</h2>
        <p>
            Although the image of the world is only characterized by Heidegger for
            modernity, it is Hui (2010) who takes up the concept to define what he
            calls altermodernity, which is nothing more than the contemporary era,
            with the digital technology that surrounds us.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Technology and Science in World Picture</h2>
        <p>
            Yuk Hui (2010), in his interpretation of Heidegger, defines the world
            picture with a proposal of the Computational Turn, which is the
            importance of digital systems, emphasizing uncertainty and networks, for
            the understanding of our time. That is to say, beyond the simple
            machine, as an object, the concept of the Computational Turn is to
            emphasize a series of discursive and social practices inscribed on
            computational logic. This can be seen in the rise of practices such as
            data visualization, social networks, or the use of the Internet in its
            different protocols.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            However, Hui does not consider the scientific aspect developed by
            Heidegger in his text on the world picture. It is in the scientific
            aspect that the openness of the media for more democratic development is
            most clearly observed. Heidegger mentions, for example, that it is the
            academic institutions and the scientific method (as it is where
            experimentation is carried out) that make science what it is and
            therefore be an essential part of modernity. But added to that, it is
            also technology that makes possible a new science, as Idhe (2015)
            comments on the new technologies of the image and how with them, it is
            possible to have a better visualization of what are the viruses or the
            stars.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            It is then that, this image world that Heidegger conceptualizes and
            takes up again Hui is based on a concept of technology. But in addition,
            for a more complete panorama, it is necessary to see the new forms of
            scientific development that technology makes possible, and that today
            more than ever, is observed with the democratization of the
            technological means.

            In response to the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic, there have been several
            initiatives to help patients or to find a vaccine, most of which have
            been carried out through the openness of media such as the Internet.
            Such is the case of associations of makers or open-source equipment
            development that helps in the making of respirators. In the case of the
            vaccine, for example, we can see the collaborative effort that ESI Group
            develops, which is the distributed computing, which allows each one of
            us, with the processing of our computers, to collaborate in simulations
            to find a vaccine.
