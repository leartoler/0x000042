            Determinism in Spinoza’s Work and Determination in the Technical Object
        </h1>
        <!-- <h4>The Shape of Design • Chapter Two</h4> -->
        <p>
            To analyze and discuss what determinism is for Spinoza is supposed to
            understand what this concept means and frame it within a larger thought:
            pantheism. In the first instance and in a very general and erroneous
            way, it can be supposed that what is determined in Spinoza is something
            already given and that there is no way out of it; however, as we will
            see throughout this essay, it supposes the opposite insofar as it is
            understood that said concept rests on God and his infinite modes.
            Therefore, this essay is composed of two parts: the first aims at
            analyzing and discussing what determinism is for Spinoza, taking into
            account his work Ethics demonstrated according to the geometrical order
            (2000). As a second point, I propose to take the concept of determinism
            according to Spinoza and extend it to the plane of technology; that is,
            to answer whether the technological object, derived in the first place
            from man, is determined by its function.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>God, Source of the Determinate</h2>
        <p>
            In the first place, Spinoza in 1P26 (1) considers God, of infinite
            attributes, as the only one who can determine a thing to act; that is to
            say, that God is the efficient cause of both the existence and the
            essence of things. But, this proposition about God, beyond the
            simplicity that it seems to keep, reveals the complexity of his thought
            about God, as the efficient cause of all things and how these, whether
            infinite or finite, being already determined, strive as far as possible
            to preserve their being, as later, in 3P7.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            God, as Spinoza maintains, is the efficient cause, and everything that
            is, is in God and without him, nothing can be conceived, so that God is
            not the only creator of all things, but everything is in God. However,
            that does not mean that the essence of things is God since, as he
            explains in 2P10, God does not belong to the essence of things since
            there is a difference between the conceived object and that which is
            given, the thing is put in or, if taken away, the thing is taken away.
            Therefore, he goes on to explain in 2P10, the essence of things is not
            God but the attributes of him, understanding the attributes as that
            which the understanding perceives of the substance as constitutive of
            its essence.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Considering the above, things, and their essences, are determined by
            God. But this does not mean that God determines, directly, all things.
            Spinoza continues in 2P13, concerning bodies, that these are determined
            (at rest or in motion) by another body, which was also determining and
            so on to infinity, so that God, as the first cause, is the one who
            determines everything, although he does not do it directly.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Counterposing this point, and observing that there may be a limitation
            as to objects and their determination, it is observed that, on the one
            hand, things cannot be different from the way they are, as he explains
            in 1P33, and on the other hand, that from the divine nature it follows
            that there are infinite things in infinite ways. On the first point he
            observes in 2P33 that things could not have been produced by God in a
            way or in an order different from the way they have been and that,
            therefore, everything has been determined by the necessity of God’s
            nature to exist and act in a certain way. He goes on to comment that the
            contingent is rather a defect in our knowledge, that we are ignorant of
            the order of causes.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            But does this mean that everything is already given? Yes and no.
            Everything is given, and determined, insofar as there is no contingency,
            but within the infinite modes that follow from the divine nature,
            nothing is given insofar as, within the infinitude of things and the
            finiteness of our knowledge, it is impossible to know these infinite
            modes. In addition to the above, as Spinoza comments in 3P6, each thing,
            insofar as it is in itself, strives to persevere in its being, so that
            the determination of things depends both on God and on the essence of
            things, which are the attributes of God.
        </p>
        <h2>The Determination on Things</h2>
        <p>
            While within the infinitude of God everything is determined (though not
            limited) it remains to be known how things remain determined in
            themselves. Spinoza, in 3P6, writes that each thing, insofar as it is in
            itself, strives to preserve its being. Thus, it is not God who continues
            to determine things, but the very essence of them and their actual
            essence. So, if there is an effort in the very essence of things, it is
            because there is the possibility, in its infinite modes, that it can
            change its determined nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this change to its determinate nature does not come by the
            thing itself, but is external to itself or, as he mentions in 3P4,
            nothing can be destroyed except by an external cause, which itself
            derives in its individuality. Therefore, as Solé (2004) mentions, the
            individual or thing is, in principle, an eternal truth that depends only
            on God and, therefore, is determined directly or indirectly to him, but
            already in its individuality, with its essence, is where it strives to
            preserve its determination. Within its own individuality and
            determination, it can only be destroyed by an external cause but,
            outside its determination, this external cause can only be of its own
            nature, as Spinoza’s notion of infinitude indicates.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            That said, the determinate in Spinoza is something that is given in an
            initial way in God, where the essence is given from his attributes,
            leading to a determination that, within his infinite modes, makes
            contingency non-existent but which they strive to preserve. Moreover, as
            noted above, this determination does not indicate that something is
            already limited or predestined, but that within these infinite modes, it
            remains to be to what is determined remains to be clarified.
        </p>

        <h2>Determination in the Technical Object</h2>

        <p>
            The determination that Spinoza expounds is observed in a metaphysical
            and general way, punctuating where it should in questions about the
            soul. However, what happens with those technical objects that, beyond
            the determination conceived by God, are already given by the human
            being? In the first instance, one could consider that they are already
            determined by the human insofar as everything is determined by another;
            however, he does not explain beyond a use that the technical object can
            exceed; that is, he does not consider a hypertelia of the technical
            object.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Returning to Simondon (2017), the hypertelia of the technical object
            occurs when it exceeds the purposes for which it was conceived or
            thought; that is, for example, that currently, the hypertelia of social
            networks have exceeded the communication for which they were initially
            conceived and giving now an ecosystem with a vast complexity. It could
            be said, then, that a technical object is not determined by the human
            who creates it, but that it achieves its autonomy after its development.
            But, as we observed in 1P33, the contingent is associated with ignorance
            of the order of things, so that if a technical object exhibits
            contingent behavior, it is a manifestation that is hidden from us of
            what we conceive. Whether they are evolutionary algorithms, machine
            learning algorithms that create their own rules, behaviors derived from
            communication in networks, everything derived from the technical object
            is nothing more than something that we fail to visualize at the moment
            of creation.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            But beyond that, the determination of the technical object is not only
            given by the one who creates the object, but also by the one who makes
            use of it. A machine, for example, whose function is determined to
            perform operations, can be determined differently by the user from the
            one who makes use of it, in the same way, that a stone can be determined
            both for use as a hammer and as a weapon. Thus, technical objects find a
            double determination in their uses and functions.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            It can be considered that Spinoza’s vision of the determinate is
            negative insofar as everything is already dictated beforehand, however,
            as we observed above, God, in His infinite modes, is in everything and
            we are all in God, but this does not mean that we are not limited. God,
            within his infinitude, lets us glimpse that determination is also given
            by an infinitude, which can only be limited by something external and
            similar. That said, the determination to which we are subject is
            infinite and, therefore, incommensurable within our finite reasoning.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            We, as individuals, are determined to be and such determination is given
            by God, either directly or indirectly. Determination, therefore, is
            something for which it is already given to each thing and individual and
            seeks to maintain.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            For the case of the technical object, we observe that, contrary to what
            is said by thinkers like Simondon or Yuk Hui, it is determined and
            given, so it is not possible to observe a contingent behavior or
            function. The determination of its function is given both by the
            attributes of God and by the determination that we humans give it, both
            by the one who creates it and by the one who intends to make different
            use of the technical object, in other words, every technical object is
            doubly determined.
