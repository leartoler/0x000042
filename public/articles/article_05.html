        <h1>The Silicon Monopoly</h1>
        <!-- <h4>The Shape of Design • Chapter Two</h4> -->
        <p>
            In Mexico, the quarantine has already ended, even though the cases of Covid 19 have not decreased. This
            change of the quarantine ending has forced me to ask myself how an action as old as confinement, together
            with social distancing, have been the alternatives used to avoid the spread of the virus.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Technologically speaking, I believe that two particular facts lead us to question why and how we came to
            this. For the first question, I believe that there is a deficiency of the State to be unable to deal with
            such a lamentable situation. For the second point, I take particular interest in monotechnology, a term used
            by Yuk Hui.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            As mentioned by de la Fuente (2002), the option of confinement and social distancing that we adopted as the
            most appropriate was a response to a mandate from a weakened State, which sees restrictions on freedom
            rather than investment in medical spending as the most viable option. This action, which seems to be common
            in Western countries, is opposed to recent events in the United States, whose protests had as an immediate
            action of the State the deployment of the army to the streets, similar to what happens in Mexico. Therefore,
            we are not talking about a weakened state, but one that is incapable of putting the welfare of its citizens
            before the interests of its leaders, the same particular fact that limits all technological capacity to the
            control of training and confinement of its citizens.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            As a second point, I mention monotechnology, in which Yuk Hui (2020) refers to it as the one that has
            monopolized all relationship with the human and has assimilated the economic as an essential element; that
            is, digital technology. This relationship with digital technology has not allowed us to think of
            alternatives beyond those already used (confinement and social distancing) or those that threaten our
            privacy, such as the strategies used in China. However, although digital technologies are those that have
            been adopted by the state apparatus, it is from the people and the community that various strategies have
            been adopted. From the resurgence of the maker movement and the creation of respirators through 3d printing
            to the return of the community as a strategy for coexistence and social development. So it is clear how
            technology has impacted us cognitively and makes us ask what other forms of knowledge could have faced this
            pandemic.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Diseases, pandemics, and how we act against them have not changed in more than 5 centuries, and the
            technology we have has only allowed us to have information to spare without any particular use to deal with
            such a pandemic. In view of this, it is necessary to see other forms of knowledge and to develop different
            types of technologies, beyond silicon and plastic. Asking and establishing a genealogy of technology in
            relation to politics can give us clues to the impact that, along with economics, changes the way we go. It
            is, therefore, necessary to think of alternatives in how to think about technology from the general to the
            individual.
