        <p>
            Let’s assume that for every fact there is a particular narrative that
            makes one have some kind of unique and subjective teaching. That said,
            as a warning, if we have “learned” anything it is that there is no
            control over our future, however immediate it may seem.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under the current situation of the pandemic we are experiencing, many of
            the questions that are asked are what happens next when all this is
            over. There are optimistic views such as that given by Žižek (2020), or
            pessimistic views such as those of Agamben (2020) and Byung Chul Han
            (2020). However, as Segato (2020) explains, we should not dwell too much
            on what is to come, but on the practices that are emerging and what is
            currently under development.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            In this article, therefore, I look at the role that technology can play,
            particularly the role that video games play in changing the ways we
            relate to each other and create community.
        </p>

            In a national context, in the health emergency in Mexico, the attitude
            that is being taken towards the individual, towards the other, is one of
            a body that gets sick and can get sick, is, therefore, an attitude of
            threat, hence the attacks on health personnel that are being reported in
            Mexico are understood. This fear of the other, together with the policy
            of distancing, is what Agamben analyzes with the term of mass (2020);
            that is, a group of united people who, paradoxically, remain distant,
            aloof, and passive.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            However, against this technology of social distancing and confinement,
            the new media are helping to change the forms of association and in the
            creation of communities. One of these new media is video games, where
            titles like Animal Crossing: New Horizons help to have a positive impact
            on emotions, and these, in a shared way, create stronger social
            relationships. Isbister (2016) comments that one of the main
            characteristics in which video games create an emotional impact is in
            the capacity to interact with others, having as common points the
            situation of a virtual world, depending on the video game. In addition
            to this, there are the features designed by the developers, such as the
            role of gifts in Animal Crossing, or the mods made by the players
            themselves, as in the case of the actions that will be performed in
            Minecraft.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Finally, while the technologies of confinement and the policies of
            social distancing are individualizing the bodies, the new media, like
            video games, are modifying and resignifying social associations and
            thinking in community, so beyond the somewhat pessimistic forecasts of
            Agamben, these forms of interaction with the other are being configured,
            and the pandemic is only visualizing and increasing it more.
