        <h1>Information in Times of Uncertainty</h1>
        <!-- <h4>The Shape of Design • Chapter Two</h4> -->
        <p>
            The crisis we are currently experiencing, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, is
            the first that we are facing globally as a digital, hyperconnected
            society. In view of this, there is a differentiating element that had
            not been presented before: the easy access to information that we have.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <p>
            However, there is an irony in this ease with which we can acquire
            information, and that is that the existence of this information is not
            the same as the understanding and interpretation that we can make, and
            furthermore, the change of an idea that we may have. The latter is what
            I discuss in this text; that is, how, despite the multiple channels of
            information, expert voices, and institutions, are there people who still
            do not believe in the problem represented by the current pandemic?
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            There are two elements that I observe in this problem: the amount of
            existing information and the inability to change someone’s mind, both
            with the concept of information and the relationship it has with an
            event given by a probability. For the first problem, I use the
            mathematical model of information, proposed by Shannon and Weaver in
            1949. In very general terms, in their mathematical model, they take into
            consideration four elements: sender, receiver, message, and noise
            (Gleick, 2011). Although its authors did not problematize much on the
            meaning of the message or its probable social aspect, it helps us to
            understand information from one of its main aspects: uncertainty. The
            greater the uncertainty, the greater the amount of information, and
            since the pandemic is currently a global problem with different nuances
            and channels, the information given daily exceeds our capacity to
            assimilate it.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            A second problem, on which I dwell more, is that despite all the
            information available on the problem, there are those who doubt its
            existence. Considering then the human factor of the receiver and his
            capacity to acquire information, we are faced with a premise expressed
            by Marcey (1971): to strengthen an opinion, less information is required
            than to weaken it.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This premise takes into consideration the uncertainty of the object or
            event, and given the great uncertainty that exists, the amount of
            information that exists is too much, which generates a high probability
            that a certain event, whatever it may be, will happen. The more
            information there is, the more uncertainty there is, and the more
            difficult it will be to change an opinion. This, together with the
            proliferation of false information, makes it reasonable that there are
            people who do not believe in the current pandemic.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This understanding raises the question of whether a solution is
            possible. A viable strategy is followed by different social networks:
            publication filtering and optimized searches. However, this strategy
            does not take into account, at least in Mexico, a large part of the
            population that does not have the Internet and that their only source of
            information is interpersonal communication and social networks without
            as much openness as Whatsapp is.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the time being, for this current crisis, there is no viable
            solution; however, as it is the first of many crises, it is necessary to
            have a communication strategy for the entire population, and to consider
            the greatest number of channels available.
        </p>
