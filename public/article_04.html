      <h2>Open technology as a way of understanding the image of the world</h2>
      <!-- <h4>The Shape of Design • Chapter Two</h4> -->
      <p>
        There have been several authors who have tried to define the essential
        characteristics of our time, taking elements that are significant to
        them, either the cultural, the political, the social or, as we will see
        below, the technological.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In this text, I propose an image and understanding of the contemporary
        world through the social and cultural change that comes from science and
        information technologies. To this end, I will take up Heidegger’s
        concept of world image, which in the first instance defines the
        essential characteristics that existed in modernity. Later, to
        understand the impact of technology and science I will consider the
        thought of Ihde, and Yuk Hui for the understanding of technology in the
        image of the contemporary world. Finally, I propose how to define our
        time based on collaborative science and technology, which, as we can
        see, is one of the characteristics that will increase after the COVID-19
        crisis.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>World Picture</h4>
      <p>
        Although the image of the world is only characterized by Heidegger for
        modernity, it is Hui (2010) who takes up the concept to define what he
        calls altermodernity, which is nothing more than the contemporary era,
        with the digital technology that surrounds us.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Technology and Science in World Picture</h4>
      <p>
        Yuk Hui (2010), in his interpretation of Heidegger, defines the world
        picture with a proposal of the Computational Turn, which is the
        importance of digital systems, emphasizing uncertainty and networks, for
        the understanding of our time. That is to say, beyond the simple
        machine, as an object, the concept of the Computational Turn is to
        emphasize a series of discursive and social practices inscribed on
        computational logic. This can be seen in the rise of practices such as
        data visualization, social networks, or the use of the Internet in its
        different protocols.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        However, Hui does not consider the scientific aspect developed by
        Heidegger in his text on the world picture. It is in the scientific
        aspect that the openness of the media for more democratic development is
        most clearly observed. Heidegger mentions, for example, that it is the
        academic institutions and the scientific method (as it is where
        experimentation is carried out) that make science what it is and
        therefore be an essential part of modernity. But added to that, it is
        also technology that makes possible a new science, as Idhe (2015)
        comments on the new technologies of the image and how with them, it is
        possible to have a better visualization of what are the viruses or the
        stars.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        It is then that, this image world that Heidegger conceptualizes and
        takes up again Hui is based on a concept of technology. But in addition,
        for a more complete panorama, it is necessary to see the new forms of
        scientific development that technology makes possible, and that today
        more than ever, is observed with the democratization of the
        technological means.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic, there have been several
        initiatives to help patients or to find a vaccine, most of which have
        been carried out through the openness of media such as the Internet.
        Such is the case of associations of makers or open-source equipment
        development that helps in the making of respirators. In the case of the
        vaccine, for example, we can see the collaborative effort that ESI Group
        develops, which is the distributed computing, which allows each one of
        us, with the processing of our computers, to collaborate in simulations
        to find a vaccine.
